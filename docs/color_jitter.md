Module invertransforms.color_jitter
===================================

Classes
-------

`ColorJitter(brightness=0, contrast=0, saturation=0, hue=0)`
:   Randomly change the brightness, contrast and saturation of an image.
    
    Args:
        brightness (float or tuple of float (min, max)): How much to jitter brightness.
            brightness_factor is chosen uniformly from [max(0, 1 - brightness), 1 + brightness]
            or the given [min, max]. Should be non negative numbers.
        contrast (float or tuple of float (min, max)): How much to jitter contrast.
            contrast_factor is chosen uniformly from [max(0, 1 - contrast), 1 + contrast]
            or the given [min, max]. Should be non negative numbers.
        saturation (float or tuple of float (min, max)): How much to jitter saturation.
            saturation_factor is chosen uniformly from [max(0, 1 - saturation), 1 + saturation]
            or the given [min, max]. Should be non negative numbers.
        hue (float or tuple of float (min, max)): How much to jitter hue.
            hue_factor is chosen uniformly from [-hue, hue] or the given [min, max].
            Should have 0<= hue <= 0.5 or -0.5 <= min <= max <= 0.5.
